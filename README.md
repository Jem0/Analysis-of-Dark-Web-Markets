#Dark Web Market Analysis

Our project will examine the 6% of the internet commonly known as the dark web. The dark web is notorious for its unrestricted content and the growing markets that support the circulation of illicit goods or services. The promised anonymity induced an increase in criminal activity on the dark web; darknet marketplaces became populated with buyers. The purpose of this project is to identify and compare the characteristics of successful vendors and characteristics of their counterparts in order to increase the number of successful sellers; we want to promote a more effective market.

We define ‘successful vendors’ to meet 2 basic criterias: long life span and high rating. We will investigate the geographical distribution of illegal goods and services and provide analysis on seller lifetimes using the metadata on one of the cryptomarkets, Agora. We asks questions such as:

- Where are most vendors located for each category? How does category popularity change by country?
- What is the correlation between a seller’s reputation and their lifespan? How much longer can top rated vendors stay in the market compared to low rated vendors? Are sellers consistently active?
- Do vendors tend to sell goods and/or services in only one category? If they sell in multiple categories, are their lifespans the same for all the categories?
- What do successful vendors have in common? Are what top rated, active vendors selling in congruence with the rest of the vendors? What exactly are they selling?
